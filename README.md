# HDI_L1

Labjack scripts adjusted for L1 pin layout. Renamed scripts from https://github.com/psi46/HDItest/tree/master/LabJack-Code

Installation instructions and prerequisites are found at the same link. Also worth noting is psi46test 
which is used to send instructions to the TBM through the DTB and is necessary to test the HDI.
